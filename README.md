## Growth Incidence Curve (GIC)

In Uruguay, a public debate is ongoing regarding the Growth Incidence Curve (GIC) for the period 2019-2023. For further information, refer to this [press coverage](https://delsol.uy/facildesviarse/cocienteanimal/crecimiento-y-desigualdad-entre-2019-y-2023-los-datos-y-el-ruido) 
and another related [interview](https://enperspectiva.uy/en-perspectiva-programa/analisis-economico/ingresos-de-los-hogares-luego-de-la-crisis-del-covid-recuperacion-importante-pero-desigual-como-hay-que-analizar-la-evidencia-con-el-economista-pablo-rosselli-socio-en-exante/).

To contribute to this discussion, I developed the following code to generate GICs at the quintile and centile levels.

The primary conclusion is that the bottom percentiles experienced a decline in income growth over this period, while the middle and top percentiles showed either negligible or positive growth. 
However, it is important to note that this analysis is still preliminary. Additionally, it is crucial to emphasize that this analysis does not imply any causation from policies to distributional outcomes.

Feel free to take the code and keep contributing to the discussion.
